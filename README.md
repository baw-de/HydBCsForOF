# HydBCsForOF

**HydBCsForOF** is a set of hydraulic engineering boundary conditions for the Volume-of-Fluid solver "interfoam" of OpenFOAM. This is neither a part of openfoam nor endorsed by the owners of OpenFOAM. The provided boundary conditions allow the specification of water flow rates for variable water levels and the prescribtions of water levels with variable flow rates.

## Installation

You have to install OpenFOAM in the ESI variant, version v2212: https://www.openfoam.com/news/main-news/openfoam-v2212. Further details are given in the accompanying paper (see below).

THERE WAS A TYPO IN THE PAPER! YOU HAVE TO EXECUTE `. ./AllWmake` !

You can copy and paste the following code directly into your command line, after you activated your OpenFOAM environment:


```
git clone https://github.com/baw-de/HydBCsForOF.git
cd HydBCsForOF/boundaryConditions
. ./AllWmake

```

The compilation should finish with a line which specifies the location and name of the compiled library.



## Development

**HydBCsForOF** is developed at the [Federal Waterways Engineering and Research Institute](https://www.baw.de/).
